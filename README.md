# Problem formulation
The goal of this task is to program a functional spam filter. Its structure is to include
the test() method and the train() method. The interest is to create an algorithm that would
evaluate SPAM or HAM with the greatest possible accuracy. There are three possible strategy. 
Create a filter with only the test() method, which will have a simple tag determination algorithm
SPAM or HAM. Or go the route of a pre-learned filter. And the last option we are
we also chose is a learning filter with the train() method
